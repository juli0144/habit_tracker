Little sceduler programm to set up a weekly routine
It works but it is the earliest working version.

Tested with Python 3.11.7
It uses customtkinter, json and datetime. Make sure to have those packages when running it with python.


If something is broken try to delete the users.json file first and recreate the user with the same name.
If that doesn't work delete both user.json and username.json files.



More features and improvement of the GUI will follow soon:


Add more users and switch between them
Delete scedules
Add scedule overwrite warning
Add a system to track actuall worktime throught start/stop task funktion
Show overall stats of tasks worktime

Improvements to the sceduler design
Improvement to the funktion bar
